Each value in this dataset does not represent an average of properties over a 5 x 5 km grid box, but rather a single sample from within each 5 km box. Normally, pixels in across-track rows 4 and 9 (counting in the direction of increasing scan number) out of every set of 10 rows are used for subsampling the 1 km retrievals to a 5 km resolution. If the array contents are determined to be all fill values after selecting the default pixel subset (e.g., from failed detectors), a different pair of pixel rows is used to perform the subsampling. Note that 5 km data sets are centered on rows 3 and 8; the default sampling choice of 4 and 9 is for better data quality and avoidance of dead detectors on Aqua. The row pair used for the 1 km sample is always given by the first number and last digit of the second number of the attribute Cell_Along_Swath_Sampling. The attribute Cell_Across_Swath_Sampling indicates that columns 3 and 8 are used, as they always are, for across-track sampling. Again these values are to be interpreted counting in the direction of the scan, from 1 through 10 inclusively. For example, if the value of attribute Cell_Along_Swath_Sampling is 3, 2028, 5, then the third and eighth pixel rows were used for subsampling. A value of 4, 2029, 5 indicates that the default fourth and ninth rows pair was used.

  1_km_to_5_km_subsampling_description:=:
Each value in this dataset does not represent an average of properties over a 5 x 5 km grid box, but rather a single sample from within each 5 km box. Normally, pixels in across-track rows 4 and 9 (counting in the direction of increasing scan number) out of every set of 10 rows are used for subsampling the 1 km retrievals to a 5 km resolution. If the array contents are determined to be all fill values after selecting the default pixel subset (e.g., from failed detectors), a different pair of pixel rows is used to perform the subsampling. Note that 5 km data sets are centered on rows 3 and 8; the default sampling choice of 4 and 9 is for better data quality and avoidance of dead detectors on Aqua. The row pair used for the 1 km sample is always given by the first number and last digit of the second number of the attribute Cell_Along_Swath_Sampling. The attribute Cell_Across_Swath_Sampling indicates that columns 3 and 8 are used, as they always are, for across-track sampling. Again these values are to be interpreted counting in the direction of the scan, from 1 through 10 inclusively. For example, if the value of attribute Cell_Along_Swath_Sampling is 3, 2028, 5, then the third and eighth pixel rows were used for subsampling. A value of 4, 2029, 5 indicates that the default fourth and ninth rows pair was used.

  1_km_to_5_km_subsampling_description:=:
Each value in this dataset does not represent an average of properties over a 5 x 5 km grid box, but rather a single sample from within each 5 km box. Normally, pixels in across-track rows 4 and 9 (counting in the direction of increasing scan number) out of every set of 10 rows are used for subsampling the 1 km retrievals to a 5 km resolution. If the array contents are determined to be all fill values after selecting the default pixel subset (e.g., from failed detectors), a different pair of pixel rows is used to perform the subsampling. Note that 5 km data sets are centered on rows 3 and 8; the default sampling choice of 4 and 9 is for better data quality and avoidance of dead detectors on Aqua. The row pair used for the 1 km sample is always given by the first number and last digit of the second number of the attribute Cell_Along_Swath_Sampling. The attribute Cell_Across_Swath_Sampling indicates that columns 3 and 8 are used, as they always are, for across-track sampling. Again these values are to be interpreted counting in the direction of the scan, from 1 through 10 inclusively. For example, if the value of attribute Cell_Along_Swath_Sampling is 3, 2028, 5, then the third and eighth pixel rows were used for subsampling. A value of 4, 2029, 5 indicates that the default fourth and ninth rows pair was used.
